# Hello from the dev team! üëãüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a bot dedicated to fun, moderation and utility


### Can I invite the bot?

Yes! You can use (this)[https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=772722250717331456&permissions=1979939943&scope=bot] link to invite the bot, or find a server with the bot in it and use the `+invite` command

### What is this bot?
This bot is the public version of the dev team's main bot, Pixel's Slave. This bot will subsequently have less feature but as of 23/12/2020, the 2 bots have been put on the same level and will be updated together so both versions of the bot have the same features. The reason this bot has less features is because the features that are missing are made for the discord server, Pixel HQ, only.

### Self hosting

Self hosting is **not** recommended as you will not receive support if you manage to break the bot, you can use our code in accordance to the [license](https://github.com/Pixel-HQ-Bot-Development/bulica/blob/main/LICENSE)
